### CodePresenter 1.1.0
New features:

   * Fixtures are folders/files that will not open views in the presentation, but will be copied directly to the sink folder
   * Substages allow activating the presentation folder by folder (top level folders under the source only)
   * Fast-Forward Points allow files to be partially written, so the presentation can start partway into a given file

See the README for more info (under Preferences-> Package Settings-> CodePresenter)
