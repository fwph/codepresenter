Small updates
    * Open the presentation files in reverse-alphabetical order so that the first alphabetically first filename is focused when the presentation runs (or a substage runs)
    * Add a setting to call sftp_upload_folder after a presentation stage is run, which should help with compatibility when your sink folder is mapped to a remote location via the SFTP plugin
    * Add a regex file pattern exclude setting
