### CodePresenter 1.0.5
Minor improvements:
   * Some fixes to directory deletion; allow ignoring particular directory names.
      * By default, \_\_pycache\_\_ will be ignored when found; this can be adjusted via the package settings.
   * Setting to touch sink files on creation: this can be desirable in some cases (should improve interactions with sftp)
   * Added settings menu items
