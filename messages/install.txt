Usage:

  * Install the plugin (by, say, linking the checkout to your Packages directory )
  * open or create a project
  * add a folder or select one that exists and has files in it
  * add a new empty folder
  * right click on the first folder (in the side bar), and select
        CodePresenter Actions -> Set Source Folder
  * right click on the empty folder (in the side bar), and select
        CodePresenter Actions -> Set Sink Folder
  * right click on any file or folder in the side bar, and select
        CodePresenter Actions -> Start Code Presentation
  * mash that keyboard!

IMPORTANT NOTES:

  * All files in the sink folder will be destroyed when the presentation is started
  * All views in the active window will be closed, even if changes have been made, when the presentation is started
  * It won't handle subdirectories nicely, yet.
  * I do not recommend mashing on the enter key; there are currently some issues with that (notably, tab insertion and various macros that occur when the enter key is pressed.)
  * The source files should be UTF-8 encoded as of version 1.2.0 to avoid causing problems
